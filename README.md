### CraftyCrafting client is the next minecraft client. Just like Lunar, Feather or optifine.

## Why this client?
Well if there are others why CraftyCrafting. 
1. This Client out of the box gives optimization, pvp essentials, redstone improvements, just quality of life improvements and even if you dont care about pvp or redstone this still gives optimization, connected textures and more to make minecraft better.
2. This client is based on fabric which means you  can do anything with it like add a car mod or furniture

This client is not only for optimization, it adds some other quality of life feature's like freelook, Controller support (touchscreen support too) or faster fly speed in creative, Pvp and redstone improvements.
